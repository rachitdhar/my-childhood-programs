# Older-projects
Some of the good projects I made during my early years with coding.

I started coding just for fun sometime in 2015, when I was in 8th standard.
Over the period of about 3-4 years after that, I kept making a huge number of projects, most of which were frankly either too simple or just useless.
But some of the projects were pretty well functioning, and they actually seem nice, at least considering that I was small back then!
So I thought to put them up over here.

Funny thing: I used to code in Visual Basic back then, which is now somewhat of a legacy language. So I thought it would be kinda cool to look at the programs I wrote in that old fashioned language syntax!
